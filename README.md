# DashFire.Dashboard.API
> DashFire is a .Net library to create jobs and services which could connect to DashFire Dashboard easily.

DashFire is totally free and open source .Net library to create jobs and services, schedule, log and manage them easily.

When you create a Worker Service in .Net, or Windows Service in .Net Framework, you'll not only care about the logic of the business, but about logging, managing, scheduling and etc. 

But using DashFire, you only implement the logic of the business, the issues like communicating with the server (DashFire Dashboard), logging, scheduling and other sort of issues will be handled by the DashFire.
Then, you can host the jobs in Services (in Windows) or Systemd (in Linux based operation systems).

DashFire.Dashboard.API is the server which jobs connect to it. The server stores the job's definitions and logs, user can execute a job using the dashboard as well, every job send the status to the server and the communications are handled by both library and server side.

### P.S. This library is an alternative to HangFire which is a professional task scheduling library used by million of people around the world. This project is not as generic as HangFire, but I wanted to make a fully customized task scheduler. This is a very fundamental version which handles the basics of communications and scheduling, for extending the library and server, you can easily fork the project and extend it.
